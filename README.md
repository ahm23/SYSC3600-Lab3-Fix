# SYSC3600-Lab3-Fix
Since our professors don't care to update their labs from 2001 that aren't compatible with modern MATLAB, here's a fixed version of the code from section 4.2 of Lab 3. There wasn't only compatibility issues but also literally mistakes in the code itself. Welcome to Carleton University, where the K stands for Quality.

## How to Run
Type drawpendulum(out); in the console after you run the simulation from lab 3 (it will generate a package of the output results called "out"). Do follow the naming conventions in the lab for this to work.
